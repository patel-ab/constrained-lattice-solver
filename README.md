# constrained-lattice-solver
Solves the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) and Quadrant-SVP (Q-SVP) using Hill Climbing (HC) and Simulated Annealing (SA). Compares computational time and solution quality to analyze heuristic optimization trade-offs in lattice problems. Implemented in Python with NumPy and Matplotlib.
